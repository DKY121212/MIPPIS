# MIPPIS
Proteinâ€“Protein Interaction Site prediction network with Multi-Information fusion

we proposed a multi-channel protein-protein interaction site prediction network. Specifically, we utilized the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) channel for spatial structural characteristics, the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) channel for primary structure sequence features, and the ProtT5 pre-trained language model for high-level semantic features derived from extensive training data.

MIPPIS is developed under Linux environment with MIPPIS.yaml

The Full_model.pkl file in the model folder is our trained model file, used for testing datasets and making predictions.
